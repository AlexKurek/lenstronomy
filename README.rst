lenstronomy
=============================

This package is designed to model strong lens systems.


Modelling Features
--------

* Extended source reconstruction with basis sets (shapelets)
* Analytic light profiles for lens and source as options
* a variety of mass models to use
* non-linear line-of-sight description
* iterative point spread function


Analysis tools
-------
* Standardized fitting procedures for some lens systems
* Modular build up to designe plugins by users
* Interactive jupyter notebooks
* Pre-defined plotting and ilustration routines
* Particle swarm optimization for parameter fitting
* MCMC (emcee from CosmoHammer)
* Cosmographic inference tools


Requirements
